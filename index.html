		<h2 class="section"> Abstract </h2>
			<p> Fossil galaxies... </p>

		<h2 class="section"> Background and Theory </h2>
			<h3 class="subsection"> Galaxies and Groups </h3>
				<p> Galaxies are collections of stars and solar systems held the same reagon of space by their mutual gravitational attractions, often orbiting around a central black hole. Galaxy groups are collections of galaxies with low velocity dispersion which are gravitationally bound to each other. </p>
				<p>Fossil groups are dominated by a single, large elliptical galaxy which has the X-ray luminosity of an entire cluster. The other cluster members are primarily small dwarf galaxies. There are no mid-range galaxies (like our Milky Way). The current theory is that these large fossil galaxies are the result of sequential mergers of all the large and mid-range galaxies. The low velocity dispersion in galaxy groups permits galaxies to join into a new, larger galaxies when they pass through or near each other.</p>
			<h3 class="subsection"> Synchrotron Emission </h3>
				<p>The strong X-ray emission seen from the intergalactic medium (IGM) around fossil galaxies can be fed by active galactic nuclei (AGN), and AGN activity can be spurred by major (and possibly minor) galaxy mergers. Synchrotron emission from charged particles accelerated by magnetic fields can tell us how recently the nucleus was fed new material, as would happen in the event of a merger.</p>

		<h2 class="section"> Research </h2>
			<p>I have been processing large quantities of low-frequency radio data [WAVELENGTHS] for REAL NAME, henceforth referred to as FG30. This data was gathered by the E-VLA, with new P-band receivers. After cleaning and calibrating [very noisy] data, I generated images of FG30.</p>

			<h3 class="subsection"> Further Investigation </h3>
				<p> The next steps are to determine low-frequency radio luminosity values for FG30 from the P-band image flux and graph the spectrum of frequency v. wavelength in order to determine the aging of synchrotron emission from the location of the "knee" on the plot. We also wish to compare radio flux distribution to optical flux distribution.</p>
				<p> All of these results will be compated to an analysis of star-formation history, assessed by taking spectra of sample regions in the galaxy and graphing the spectrum as though it is a single star. If there are multiple distinct stellar populations, their age could shed light on the merger history of the galaxy. This is because star formation can be triggered by mergers, just as AGN activity can be stimulated form the infall of new material. </p>
				<p> In the future, we hope to conduct these same observations on many more fossil galaxies and compare the resulting flux to images taken at many other wavelengths.</p>

			<p> Thank you to the UW Madison Astrophysics REU Program and to the National Science Foundation for providing this wonderful opportunity. I wish to express my gratitude to Dr. Eric Wilcots and Anna Williams for their assistance on this project, and to Dr. Eric Hooper for keeping the REU program running smoothly. I would also like to thank my fellow REU participants for helping to form such a wonderful community during this program, and lasting friendships for the future. </p>
